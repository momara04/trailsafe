# TrailSafe ‚õ∞Ô∏è  
**Your Personal Hiking Safety Companion**

TrailSafe is a **full-stack mobile/web application** designed to keep hikers safe through **real-time anomaly detection, emergency escalation, offline-first navigation, and contextual hike planning.** Built with a polished UI/UX frontend and a robust backend, TrailSafe combines **machine learning, geolocation, weather APIs, and safety automation** into a single platform.

## üöÄ Key Features  

### üîí Safety First
- **Anomaly Detection (Machine Learning)**  
  TrailSafe continuously monitors a hiker‚Äôs movement patterns and uses ML-based models to detect irregularities such as:  
  - **Unusual acceleration/deceleration** (e.g., sudden sprinting or slowing).  
  - **Unusual elevation drops** (e.g., falling/slipping scenarios).  
  - **Extended idleness** when moving was expected.  
  - **Erratic directional changes** inconsistent with a trail path.  
  On detection, the app issues an **Amber Alert‚Äìstyle nudge** (sound + vibration). If unacknowledged, it escalates by contacting **emergency contacts** with the user‚Äôs last known location, and ultimately **notifies local authorities** if no contact is established.  

- **Smart Check-In System**  
  Users set customizable check-in intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes). A timer ensures hikers confirm they‚Äôre safe. If a check-in is missed:  
  1. Emergency contacts are notified with real-time GPS location.  
  2. If unresponsive, authorities receive a full safety report.  

- **SOS One-Tap Alert**  
  A persistent emergency button lets hikers instantly alert contacts/authorities.

### üó∫Ô∏è Navigation & Tracking
- **Live GPS Tracking**  
  - Records duration, location, elevation gain, and distance.  
  - **Breadcrumb Trail**: step-by-step logs of locations, timestamps, and elevation.  
  - Strong GPS accuracy indicators for reliability.  

- **Offline Maps**  
  - Download maps for major parks (Rocky Mountain, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Zion, etc.).  
  - Offline-first mode ensures navigation works without cell service.  

- **Trail Database**  
  - Searchable by **name, location, or features**.  
  - Filter by difficulty (*Easy, Moderate, Hard*).  
  - Trail cards include distance, elevation, estimated time, community ratings, and elevation profiles.  
  - Tags for **scenic views, waterfalls, wildlife, photography spots, family-friendly terrain**, etc.

### üå¶Ô∏è Contextual Awareness
- **Real-Time Weather Fetching**  
  - Integrates with external weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeather, NOAA).  
  - Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and trail conditions.  
  - Provides **safety advisories** for upcoming weather risks (storms, extreme heat, etc.).  

- **Wildlife Alerts (Crowdsourced + API-fed)**  
  - Real-time alerts for wildlife sightings (bear, mountain lion, rattlesnake, elk herds, coyote packs, etc.).  
  - Severity levels: **High / Medium / Low**.  
  - Each report includes location, distance from user, and timestamp.  
  - Promotes community safety through **hiker-submitted sightings**.

- Categorized into:  
  - Essential Gear  
  - Clothing  
  - Food & Water  
  - Safety & First Aid  
  - Navigation & Communication  
- Interactive checklist with progress tracking to encourage **safe preparation**.
